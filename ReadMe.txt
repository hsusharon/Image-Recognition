All my code is run on jupyter notebook (The python code is also in the /code/python/ folder)
There are 4 ipynb files in the /code/ipynb folder that runs each section in the project
package required to run the code:
tensorflow (version 2.7.0), panda, numpy, sklearn, os, cv2

1.633Proj2_SVM.py runs the SVM section in the project
  The experiment is tested in three different kernels 
  run time approximately 10 minutes(with GPU)

2.633Proj2_LR.py runs the Logistic Regression section in the project
 

3.633Proj2_CNN.py runs the CNN(mnist dataset) of the section
    

4.633Proj2_TL.py runs the Transfer Learning section in the project
  The training dataset should be place in the route of "C:/Users/USER/Desktop/633 Proj2/data/Monkey Database/training/training/"
  The testing dataset should be place in the route of "C:/Users/USER/Desktop/633 Proj2/data/Monkey Database/validation/validation/"
  There are two models, one trains in 25 epoch and the other trains in 50 epoch
